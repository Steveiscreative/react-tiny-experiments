/**
 * Hello, World” Component with Props
      Concepts: Functional components, props, JSX
      What to do:
	- Create a simple functional component called <Greeting> that accepts a name prop and renders “Hello, {name}! Welcome to React.”
	- Render <Greeting name="Alice" /> and <Greeting name="Bob" /> inside your App component.
	- Experiment by passing different data types to props (strings, numbers, booleans) and conditionally rendering based on those props.
	- Goal: Ensure you understand how to pass and use props, and how JSX translates to JavaScript function calls.
